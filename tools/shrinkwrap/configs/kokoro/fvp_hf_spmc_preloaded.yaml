  Overlay to enable the Driver with Hafnium as SPMC.
  This overlay preloads the Hafnium SPMC and its associated artifacts
  directly into the FVP model.

run:
  rtvars:
    SPMC_DTB:
      type: path
      value: ''

  params:
    # Load Hafnium SPMC binary at 0x06000000
    # Spacing Offset 3: adds spacing to keep key unique for Shrinkwrap
    '   --data cluster0.cpu0': out/reference/secure_aem_v8a_fvp_vhe_clang/hafnium.bin@0x6000000

    # Load SPMC DTB at 0x0403F000
    # Spacing Offset 4: prevents YAML key override
    '    --data cluster0.cpu0': ${rtvar:SPMC_DTB}@0x403F000

# Note: SPs inclusion is applied via overlay (dynamically generated) from hftest.py script.
