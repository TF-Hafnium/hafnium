  Shrinkwrap currently requires every repository to have a non-null path to run
  the clean command, even if the path is wrong or not actually used.
  In hafnium.yaml, the HAFNIUM_SRC variable is set to null, and since the clean
  command doesnâ€™t accept btvars, Shrinkwrap clean fails when used with
  hafnium-tftf.yaml.
  This overlay sets a dummy path for the HAFNIUM source directory so the clean
  command can succeed.
