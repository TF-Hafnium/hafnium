/*
 * FF-A UUIDs related to the test partitions providing test services to the
 * Primary VM. These service partitions can either be SPs or VMs, and should
 * be used only once for either an SP or VM.
 * This allows for the PVM to communicate with the service partition, regardless
 * of the ID, which has a bit related to the security state of the partition.
 * The PVM should use the UUID to retrieve the FF-A ID of the partition, before
 * attempting to communicate with it. Thus, the code for the PVM becomes
 * portable between setups where the test service is either a VM or an SP.
