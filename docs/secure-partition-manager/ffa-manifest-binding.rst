FF-A manifest binding to device tree
====================================

The manifest binding document defines the nodes and properties used to define a partition,
according to the FF-A specification. All the SPMC projects under trustedfirmware.org,
including hafnium, adhere to a common `binding document`_ hosted as part of the
TF-A project documentation.
